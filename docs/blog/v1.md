# MDX goes stable

It‚Äôs been a year and a half since the first MDX commit and a year since MDX was first announced at
ZEIT Day.  MDX is a radical paradigm shift in how to write immersive content using components.  It‚Äôs
an open, authorable format that makes it fun to write again.

Over the last we‚Äôve been working on numerous bug fixes, new features, better parsing, and integration
tests.  Now, we think it‚Äôs ready.  **We‚Äôre happy to finally release v1!**

## üéâ What‚Äôs new?

Here‚Äôs a rough breakdown on what we‚Äôve been working on:

### Parsing

We‚Äôve put a lot of work into improving the parsing of MDX documents.  This not only includes better
handling of import and export blocks, but being more flexible with JSX blocks.  We won‚Äôt get into the
nitty gritty here, but rest assured we‚Äôve added many more tests and are handling all the edge cases
we‚Äôve currently encountered (please open an issue if you find a new parse issue üò∏).

### remark-mdx

`remark-mdx` is the syntactic extension for MDX in remark.  With `remark-mdx` you can parse MDX documents
and perform transformations before writing them back to MDX strings.  This allows tools like prettier
to use the exact same parser as MDX core by installing the library.

### Custom pragma

With v1 we‚Äôve moved away from using `MDXTag` and are using a custom pragma which wraps `React.createElement`.
We decided to update this approach so the JSX output is more legible, lighterweight, and more customizable.
This means that we can add support for any library that speaks JSX!

Special thanks to [@christopherbiscardi](https://christopherbiscardi.com) for implementing this feature.

### üìö Documentation

Good libraries need great docs, so we‚Äôve been working on adding content and improving the overall documentation
website experience.

*   [Search (thanks Algolia)](https://mobile.twitter.com/4lpine/status/1114270174096412672)
*   [Guides](https://mdxjs.com)
*   [Automatic deployment via ZEIT](https://zeit.co)
*   [Custom Gatsby theme](https://gatsbyjs.org)
*   Reorganization and misc updates

Special thanks to [@jxnblk](https://jxnblk.com) and [@wooorm](https://wooorm.com) for their help improving the
docs and updating the build tooling.

## Breaking changes

Unfortunately, we‚Äôve had to introduce a few breaking changes, but we‚Äôve written a migration guide which
will walk you through the steps needed to upgrade.

*   üö®`@mdx-js/tag` is replaced by `@mdx-js/react` and an `@mdx` pragma - [migration guide](/migrating/v1#pragma)
*   MDXProvider now merges component contexts when nested - [migration guide](/migrating/v1#mdxprovider)
*   React support now requires `>= 16.8` in `@mdx-js/react` - [migration guide](/migrating/v1#react)

## Deprecations

Luckily, we only need to introduce one deprecation.  The `mdPlugins` and `hastPlugins` options have been renamed
`remarkPlugins` and `rehypePlugins` respectively.  For the time being we will issue a warning when the old options
are used.  In v2, the old options will be removed.

## üìà Growth

A major release is always a good time to take a step back and reflect on what‚Äôs been happening in terms of growth
and the greater community.  The ecosystem surrounding MDX has already grown larger than we ever imagined.  We‚Äôve also
seen projects/products/application we never even imagined.

### Ecosystem

*   [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
*   [Docz](https://docz.site)
*   [MDX Deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck)
*   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
*   [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org)
*   [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net)
*   [Vue support (alpha)](/vue)
*   [Demoboard](https://frontarm.com/demoboard/)
*   [Editors](/editors)

### Numbers

*   **Downloads**: 125,000/week, 2.4M total
*   **Stars**: 6,200
*   **Contributors**: 50
*   **Pull requests**: 281
*   **Commits**: 670

The contributor growth is one of the most important aspects here as we have numerous community members that are familiar
with MDX internals.  This allows us to continually improve the project and spread the workload against an ever growing
team of contributors.

## üõ£ Roadmap

With v1 released we have a roadmap in place that we‚Äôll continue working towards over the next 6 months or
so in addition to bug fixes and parsing issues we might encounter.

*   MDXs: [#454](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/454)
*   Interleaving: [#195](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/195)
*   Global shortcodes: [#508](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/pull/508)
*   Stable Vue support: [#238](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/238)
*   Blocks: MDX WYSIWYG: [blocks/blocks](https://github.com/blocks/blocks)
*   MDX playground inspired by AST Explorer: [#220](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/220)
*   New splash page: [#444](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/444)
*   Showcase page: [#414](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/issues/414)

### Vue support

Supporting Vue is an important goal for MDX and is one of the primary reasons we‚Äôve rearchitected MDX to use
custom pragma.  We‚Äôre delighted that we now have an alpha of Vue working.  If anyone from the Vue community
wants to give it a try and provide feedback we‚Äôd be eternally grateful.

[See the Vue example](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx/tree/master/examples/vue)

### Blocks project

One of the key missing aspects of authoring MDX documents is the editing experience.  Currently, there isn‚Äôt an
approachable way to write MDX unless you enjoy working in a text editor and writing raw Markdown/code.  We‚Äôd
like to solve that and have begun work on an MDX ‚Äúblocks editor‚Äù that‚Äôs a content focused WYSIWYG.  Not to mention,
we‚Äôll be doing all that we can to make sure the editor is as accessible as it can be from the beginning.

When we have a beta ready we will be open sourcing it and announcing, so stay tuned.

## unified collective

MDX is part of the unified collective, which is an open source ecosystem for dealing with many sources of content. unified
projects are used all over the web, and it would never be possible without the financial support.
