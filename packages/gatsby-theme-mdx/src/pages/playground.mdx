# Playground

Write some MDX code and see it render to the right. Below, you can also
see the output JSX and the intermediary ASTs. This can be helpful for
debugging or exploring how MDX works.

export const initialValue =
  typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.localStorage['lastMDXPlayground']

<PlaygroundEditor
  code={initialValue || '# Hello, world!'}
  onChange={value => {
    window.localStorage['lastMDXPlayground'] = value
  }}
/>
